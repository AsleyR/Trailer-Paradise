## About Project
This website is made using React.Ts and TailwindCSS for the front-end. And, Express.ts, along with Sass (used in the homepage route of the back-end server) and MongoDB for the back-end.

**Trailer Paradise** is made with the intent of simply being a learning project. All of the trailers shown in it are not owned by _**me**_ but by their _**respective parties**_.
