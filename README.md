## About project
This website is made with _React_ and _Tailwind CSS_ for the front-end and, although not implemented yet, _Express_ for the back-end.

**Trailer Paradise** is made with the intent of simply being a learning project. All of the trailers shown in it are not own by me but by their own respectives parties.
